  "Description" : "Yes, same-sex marriage is legal in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the landmark case of Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 that the right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This decision legalized same-sex marriage throughout the United States and requires all states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples on the same terms as opposite-sex couples. Prior to this decision, same-sex marriage was not legal in all states, but a patchwork of state laws and court decisions had begun to allow it in some states. The Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges effectively made same-sex marriage legal nationwide.",
