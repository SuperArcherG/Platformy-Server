{
  "Name" : "Pansexual Cow",
  "Description" : "It is not possible for a cow or any animal to be pansexual, as sexual orientation is a concept that is specific to humans and is based on a person's emotional, physical, and sexual attraction to others. Sexual orientation is typically described as being either straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or pansexual, and these terms refer to the gender(s) of the people that an individual is attracted to. Cows do not experience sexual attraction or have a sexual orientation, as they do not have the capacity for complex thoughts or emotions.",
